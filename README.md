Penetration test scripts.


If you need to perform port scanning, consider using NMAP instead of these scripts. 
These were developed for educational purposed only.

NMAP is a wonderful tool with huge and granular capabilities for scanning networks in general, 
and it is what I use when performing penetration tests in my network engineering adventures.
